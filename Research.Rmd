## M.S. Research

During my M.S., I investigated the effects of hydrology (precipitation, drought, flow dynamics) on harmful algae in reservoirs under the supervision of Dr. Adam M. Milewski. My thesis research took place in Lakes Sidney Lanier and Allatoona, two Georgia, U.S.A. reservoirs in the Southeastern Piedmont ecoregion.

## Undergraduate Research

During my undergraduate work, I worked under Dr. Sam Swanson to investigate primary phosphate mineralogy in a lithium pegmatite, and under Dr. Mike Roden to investigate the petrogenesis of the Banco Bonito rhyolites from the Valles Caldera, NM.
